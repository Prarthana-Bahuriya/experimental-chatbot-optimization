# Optimizing Chatbot User Satisfaction through Bayesian Optimization

This repository contains the materials for an experimental optimization project focused on maximizing chatbot user satisfaction. We utilize Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to identify optimal configurations of key chatbot parameters.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to maximize chatbot user satisfaction by identifying the optimal configuration of three key parameters: Engagement Calibration ($x_1$), Responsiveness Factor ($x_2$), and Contextual Balance ($x_3$) within a constrained environment. [cite_start]The user satisfaction score ($Y$) serves as the target variable[cite: 3].

## Methodology

The optimization strategy involved the following key steps:

* [cite_start]**Data Collection**: Measurements were collected daily from a server API, with each API call returning a satisfaction score for given parameters[cite: 12, 13].
* **Data Analysis**: Raw data was processed to extract useful insights and clean anomalies. [cite_start]Statistical analysis was performed to identify trends and correlations[cite: 15, 16].
* [cite_start]**Optimization**: Bayesian Optimization was employed to iteratively find the best parameter combination[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]**Validation**: A/B testing was used to compare the baseline (A) with optimized parameters (B), assessing both statistical significance (p-value) and practical significance (business impact)[cite: 19, 20, 21].

## Key Parameters

* [cite_start]`x1`: Engagement Calibration [cite: 5]
* [cite_start]`x2`: Responsiveness Factor [cite: 6]
* [cite_start]`x3`: Contextual Balance [cite: 7]
* [cite_start]`Y`: User Satisfaction Score [cite: 8]

## Dataset Overview

* [cite_start]**Data Source**: Data collected from server API calls with `sid=1979`[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Structure**: Each record contains the date, API URL, parameters ($x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$), and user satisfaction score ($y$)[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]**Initial Statistics**: After cleaning, there were 32 valid samples[cite: 28]. [cite_start]The average satisfaction score was 93.92, with a standard deviation of 7.03[cite: 29, 30].
* [cite_start]**Data Preprocessing**: Removed NaN values and extracted $x$ values and satisfaction scores from JSON responses[cite: 32, 33].

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights

### [cite_start]Distribution Analysis [cite: 35]

* [cite_start]`x1`: Shows moderate spread across the range [0, 1][cite: 39].
* [cite_start]`x2`: Skewed distribution with higher frequency near 0.6[cite: 40].
* [cite_start]`x3`: Concentration near lower and mid-range values[cite: 41].
* `y`: Majority of satisfaction scores are clustered around the mean (93.92) with some variability. [cite_start]The response variable ($y$) shows a relatively normal distribution centered around the mean[cite: 42, 43].
* *(See `results/distributions.png` for visualizations)*

### [cite_start]Pairwise Relationships and Correlation [cite: 45, 55]

* [cite_start]`x2` shows a strong positive correlation with satisfaction ($y$) (0.67), indicating a strong impact on satisfaction[cite: 52, 56].
* [cite_start]`x3` is negatively correlated with $y$ (-0.67), suggesting an inverse relationship[cite: 53, 57].
* [cite_start]`x1` has a weaker negative correlation with $y$ (-0.44), implying a moderate impact[cite: 54, 58].

## Modeling and Optimization

### [cite_start]Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) [cite: 61]

* [cite_start]**Why GPR?**: Efficient for modeling noisy data and generating uncertainty estimates[cite: 63].
* [cite_start]**Implementation**: Used a Matern kernel with length scale = 0.1 and $\nu=2.5$[cite: 65]. [cite_start]The model was trained on cleaned data ($x_1, x_2, x_3 \rightarrow y$)[cite: 66].
* [cite_start]**Results**: Achieved an in-sample R² of 0.999[cite: 68]. [cite_start]Predicted vs. actual satisfaction scores showed a nearly perfect fit[cite: 69].
* [cite_start]**Insight**: GPR is a reliable model for optimizing chatbot parameters, enabling confident exploration of the parameter space[cite: 71, 72].
* *(See `results/gpr_actual_vs_predicted.png` for evaluation plot)*
* *(See `results/gpr_predicted_surface_x3_0.3.png` and `results/gpr_predicted_contour_x3_0.3.png` for 3D/2D visualizations of GPR predictions)*

### Best Parameter Identification

* [cite_start]**Method**: 5000 random samples were generated in the parameter space $[0,1]^3$, and the trained GPR model predicted satisfaction scores ($y$)[cite: 76].
* [cite_start]**Best Found Parameters (B)**[cite: 78]:
    * [cite_start]$x_1$: 0.0315 [cite: 79]
    * [cite_start]$x_2$: 0.6625 [cite: 80]
    * [cite_start]$x_3$: 0.3712 [cite: 81]
* [cite_start]**Predicted Satisfaction Score at B**: 108.69[cite: 84]. [cite_start]This is the maximum predicted satisfaction score based on the sampled parameter space[cite: 85].
* **Significance**: These results identify the optimal parameter configuration for the chatbot. [cite_start]Bayesian optimization with GPR ensures efficient exploration of the parameter space for the best possible user satisfaction score[cite: 86, 87, 88]. [cite_start]This configuration will be validated in A/B testing[cite: 89].

### [cite_start]Response Surface Model (RSM) [cite: 90]

* [cite_start]**Model Fit**: The second-order polynomial regression achieved an R² score of 0.8735[cite: 92].
* [cite_start]**Significance**: This R² indicates that approximately 87.35% of the variance in $y$ is explained by the polynomial model[cite: 94].
* [cite_start]**Conclusion**: Compared to GPR (R² $\approx$ 0.9987), the polynomial model performs well but is less flexible for capturing complex relationships[cite: 95, 96, 97].
* *(See `results/rsm_actual_vs_predicted.png` and `results/rsm_residual_plot.png` for evaluation and residual plots)*

### Model Evaluation: GPR vs. RSM

* [cite_start]**Comparison**: GPR significantly outperforms RSM, providing more precise predictions with minimal residuals[cite: 151]. [cite_start]This reinforces GPR's suitability for capturing complex, non-linear relationships[cite: 152].
* [cite_start]**Conclusion**: While RSM is effective for simpler models, GPR offers superior performance in this context, making it the preferred approach for optimizing user satisfaction[cite: 153, 154].

## Bayesian Optimization Convergence

[cite_start]The convergence plot demonstrates how the optimization algorithm explores the parameter space and gradually converges to the best parameters, achieving a predicted $y$ of approximately 102. The rapid improvement in early iterations, followed by stabilization, indicates effective parameter tuning[cite: 174, 175].
* *(See `results/convergence_plot.png`)*

## Normal Distribution of Predicted Optimal Y Values

The optimal predicted $y$ value is centered at a mean of 94.76, with a standard deviation of $\pm$2.17. [cite_start]The shaded region within $\pm$1 standard deviation encompasses most predicted values, aligning with the expected distribution for GPR predictions[cite: 179, 180, 181]. [cite_start]This distribution helps in understanding the certainty and variability of the optimized parameter predictions[cite: 182].
* *(See `results/optimal_y_distribution.png`)*

## A/B Test Results

[cite_start]The A/B test was conducted to validate if the optimized parameters (B) are statistically and practically better than the baseline (A)[cite: 189].

* [cite_start]**Mean Satisfaction before Optimization**: 92.39[cite: 186].
* [cite_start]**Mean Satisfaction after Optimization**: 100.52[cite: 187].
* **T-Test**:
    * [cite_start]T-statistic: -38.94 [cite: 192]
    * [cite_start]P-value: <0.001 [cite: 193]
    * [cite_start]Conclusion: Statistically significant improvement[cite: 194].
* **Confidence Intervals**:
    * [cite_start]A: [95.92, 95.92] [cite: 196]
    * [cite_start]B: [107.71, 109.01] [cite: 197]
    * [cite_start]No overlap, confirming significant improvement[cite: 198].
* [cite_start]**Practical Significance**: The predicted satisfaction for B (108.69) exceeds the practical significance threshold of 100[cite: 200, 201].

## Conclusion
